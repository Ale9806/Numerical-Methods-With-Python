# Numerical Methods with Python
by Eduardo Alejandro Lozano Garcia.

This is a short introduction to Numerical Methods in python 3. All the functions are validated, but they may be some errors in the proofs (since I did this project in 3 days) If you find one, please send me a message or create a pull request. The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to be communicative, feel free to use the code for any application.
